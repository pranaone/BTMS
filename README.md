# Bank Transaction Management System
This C#.NET program was written as a final project for my HND Computing & Systems Development Program

Developed a C#.NET desktop application as a prototype to demonstrate the possibility of integrating two separate banking systems such as account opening and transaction processing into a single application.
Key Features : Account mandate auto generation and printing, customer information (photo and signature) maintenance, transaction processing (deposits, withdrawal and fund transfers) and transaction logs.

Project Includes Visual Studio Solution Files, MS-SQL database Script and Backup.
